# Plastic detection and classification using deep learning neural networks
This project aims to create an automated plastic waste disposal system that can categorize waste into four categories - PET, PP, HDPE, and LDPE. This system uses imaging processing techniques and artificial intelligence, specifically in-depth learning and convolutional neural networks, to improve the recycling process.

### Problem Statement
Although plastic pollution is one of the most significant environmental issues today, there is still a gap in information about monitoring the local distribution of plastics. Manual waste disposal is a complex and expensive process, and plastic waste management is a global challenge. The biggest challenge is to differentiate between different types of objects in the group, such as to filter different colors of glass or plastic, and this is important because certain types of plastic can be recycled.

### Solution
The proposed solution is an automated plastic waste disposal system that can categorize waste into four categories. This system uses imaging processing techniques and artificial intelligence, specifically in-depth learning and convolutional neural networks, to differentiate between different types of plastic. The system can work in a filter plant or a citizen home and can be accessed through mobile devices.

### Benefits
This automated plastic waste disposal system offers several benefits, including:

Increases the efficiency of the recycling process
Reduces the complexity and cost of manual waste disposal
Helps in solving urban waste problems
Provides an effective way to differentiate between different types of plastic, which can be recycled and used in the production of various materials
### Usage
To use this system, you need to capture the image of the waste using your mobile device, and the system will categorize it into one of the four categories - PET, PP, HDPE, or LDPE. This system can be used in a filter plant or a citizen home to automate the recycling process and reduce waste.
